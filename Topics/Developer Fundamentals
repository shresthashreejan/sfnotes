- Formula fields allow inserting references to fields from a parent object. Fields of objects that are up to 10 relationships away can be referenced in a formula field of a current object.
- Roll-up summary fields aggregate values from child records on the parent record.
- The sharing setting that is available in the Master-Detail Options of a junction object determines whether a user has edit, create, and delete access to the junction object records based on the level of access the user has on both master objects.
- If users only have 'read' access to the master objects, then 'Read Only' option should be selected to allow them to perform CRUD operations on the junction object.
- 'Read' is not a valid value for the junction object.
- A formula field can return a link with the session Id as a parameter by using the HYPERLINK and GETSESSIONID functions.
- Formula fields do not support Long/Rich/Encrypted Text Area fields.
- Custom formula fields are not available in Connect Offline, Web-to-Lead forms or Web-to-Case forms.
- The detail object in a master-detail relationship inherits the sharing settings of the master object.
- Objects in lookup relationships are loosely coupled and have independent sharing settings.
- Lookup and master-detail relationships are not available on the User object.
- The User object can only be linked with itself, which is possible by using a hierarchical relationship.
- The Data Import Wizard will allow importing of selected standard objects and all custom objects.
- If more than 50000 records need to be processed in a single transaction, then Data Loader can be used.
- Basic Data Import can be turned on in Salesforce Setup to give users access to a guided process for importing data using a CSV file and a simple data-mapping interface.
- Basic Data Import is supported for Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited editions of Salesforce.
- An External Id field can be used to associate records instead of the usual Record Id. While relating records using this approach, the child object must have an existing relationship field to the parent object such as a lookup or master-detail relationship. This relationship field is where the parent record reference is added and establishes the association between the two records.
- External Id is only necessary at the parent object.
- A roll-up summary field can be created on any object on the master side of a master-detail relationship.
- Some exceptions where roll-up summary fields can be used in a lookup relationship are: Opportunity-Opportunity Product, Account-Opportunity, and Campaign-Campaign Member.
- Salesforce does not allow cross-object formula fields or formula fields that reference fields from another object, to be used in roll-up summary fields.
- Owner field on detail side is automatically set to the owner of the master record. So, detail side cannot have queues.
- Indirect lookup relationship links a child external object to a parent standard or custom object.
- External lookup relationship links a child salesforce object to a parent external object.
- A junction object is required to establish a many-to-many relationship.
- Schema Builder has limitations such as being unable to add newly created fields to page layouts, configure field-level security settings, create Geolocation custom fields etc.
- An image (stored in documents) can be displayed conditionally using a formula field using the IMAGE() function.
- The isFormulaTreatNullNumberAsZero() method of the DescribeFieldResult class returns true if null is treated as zero in a formula field, and false otherwise.
- Cross-object formula fields can reference field values from related parent records.
- Data from a record can be visible to the user through cross-object formula fields even if the user does not have access to the record.
- Formula fields can reference field values from related parent objects that are up to 10 relationships away.
- Formula fields cannot reference values from child records.
- The file field type cannot be converted into other data types.
- External lookup relationship links child standard, custom, or external object to parent external object using the standard external ID field on the parent external object.
- Lookup relationship links child standard, custom, or external oject to parent standard or custom object.
- Master-detail relationship can only be used to link a child custom object to parent standard or custom object.
- Indirect lookup relationship allows linking a child external object to a parent standard or custom object using a custom unique external ID field on the parent.
- Objects on the detail side of a master-detail relationship do not have an associated sharing object, and access to the detail records is determined by the master object sharing object and the sharing setting of the relationship.
- Cross-object formula fields can pull data from records even if the user does not have access to it.
- Formula fields cannot reference values from child records.
- Lightning app pages, record pages, home pages, and email application panes can be built using Lightning App Builder.
- Standard objects are always the master.
- If an organization uses multiple currencies, the currency of the master record determines the currency of the roll-up summary field.
- Objects on the detail side of a master-detail relationship do not have a sharing object.
- The getLabel() method of the DescribeSObjectResult class returns the object's label.
- In order to publish event messages using SOAP API, the create() call is used instead of a POST request.
- EMP connector is used to subscribe to platform event messages.
- getGlobalDescribe() method can be used to obtain metadata information about all the sObjects in an organization.
- describeSObjects() method is used to obtain metadata, such as the object properties and field list, of a single sObject or multiple sObjects.
- CometD is a communication framework that uses long-polling to retrieve messages across systems.
- EMP (Enterprise Messaging Platform) connector serves as a wrapper to simplify the implementation of CometD in a system such as Salesforce.
