- A static method, which can be used as a utility method, is called without instantiating the class it is defined in.
- If a limit is set on the entire query, results are evenly distributed among the objects returned.
- Limits can be set per individual object.
- Unlike process Builder, workflow rules do not have the capability to submit records for approval or update child records.
- Workflow rules and processes are both capable of creating task records at multiple intervals.
- SOQL does not support the wild card character, or asterisk '*', unlike SQL.
- The GROUP BY clause can be used together with the COUNT(fieldName) aggregate function to return data that groups and counts the number of records based on a field value.
- To specify the maximum stack depth of a queuable job, the MaximumQueueableStackDepth property of the AsyncOptions class can be used. Setting the property overrides the default stack depth limit of certain orgs such as Developer and Trial Edition orgs.
- The second parameter of the System.enqueueJob method is used for specifying a delay (Integer) or options (AsyncOptions).
- Outbound messaging uses the notifications() call to send SOAP messages over HTTP(S) to a designated endpoint. A record-triggered flow can trigger an outbound message using a core action.
- Unlike Flow Builder, Process Builder does not support sending outbound messages.
- The second parameter of the Database.insert(param, param) method is an optional 'allOrNone' parameter.
- Inner classes can only be one level deep. If the access modifier is not specified for an inner class, it is considered private.
- The 'Allow Approvals' in Chatter settings enable approvers to receive approval request notifications via Chatter.
- The RETURNING clause is an optional clause that can be used in SOSL queries to specify the information that should be returned in the search result.
- An Enum is an abstract data type used to contain a predefined set of finite values or identifiers that cannot be modified at runtime.
- The % and _ wildcards are supported for the LIKE operator. The % wildcard matches zero or more characters. The _ wildcard matches exactly one character.
- To retrieve the latitude and longitude values of a geolocation field in SOQL, the suffixes -__Latitude__s' and '__Longitude__s' are appended to the API name without the '__c' of the custom field. For example: SELECT Id, Name, Location__Latitude__s, Location__Longitude__s FROM Conference__c.
- By default, Apex code in classes, triggers, or web services runs in system mode where the permissions and record sharing of the current user are not taken into account. Server-side Lightning component controllers or @AuraEnabled classes, implicitly use 'with sharing' if no sharing keyword is defined on the class. This means that record-level security is enforced by default in custom Lightning components.
- An access modifier is not required in the declaration of an inner class.
- Definition modifiers (such as virtual, abstract) are optional.
- Escalation rules are used for automated escalation of cases upon meeting a certain criteria.
- Assignment rules are used for automatically assigning a case or lead to an owner.
- Approval requests can be sent to individual users or a queue.
- Profile and Record Type are standard objects that do not support DML operations.
- Salesforce only restores lookup relationships that have not been replaced.
- Undelete can restore opportunity-quote associations.
- A custom email handler can be defined to handle inbound emails and perform operations such as creating or updating records based on the email content.
- Email-to-Case creates a new case from an email sent to a specific address.
- Process Builder cannot process an incoming email.
- The default sharing settings for Apex classes is 'without sharing'.
- Inner classes do not inherit the sharing setting of their container class.
- Salesforce enforces a DML limit of 150 statements per Apex transaction.
- The <apex:pageMessages> component is used to display all messages that are generated for all components on the current page including error messages.
- NoAccessException will be thrown when an unauthorized user attempts to access a secured record.
- Generic Exception can be used to handle almost all Exception types.
- If multiple triggers are used to handle the different event types for the same sObject, there is no control over the order in which the triggers are fired when a single transaction invokes different event types.
- Trigger.old is always read-only.
- Trigger.new cannot be deleted.
- In a 'before update' trigger, before the DML operation is committed, field values can be changed using the 'trigger.new' context variable.
- Partial processing returns the results of an insert or update operation in an array of Database.SaveResult objects.
- Failed or succeeded records can be determined by looping through the array of Database.SaveResult object and using the isSuccess method.
- Upto 2 levels of relationships are allowed in a parent-to-child relationship query. However, when using SOAP or REST to perform SOQL queries on objects, upto 5 levels of relationships can be specified.
- Upto 5 levels of relationships are allowed in a child-to-parent relationship query.
- Apex class must implement the 'Iterator' interface to use a custom iterator, which contains two methods 'hasNext' and 'next'.
- Future method can only return void and does not support other return types.
- Future method cannot invoke another future method.
- Apex triggers can be activated or deactivated. The 'Active' checkbox available while editing a trigger can be used to turn the trigger on or off in a sandbox environment. The deactivated trigger can be deployed to production to disable the trigger in production.
- Triggers cannot be used to detect a 'before undelete' event. 'after undelete' is supported.
- The number of SOQL queries allowed in a synchronous transaction is up to 100 only.
- SOSL statements evaluate to a list of lists of sObjects. Each list contains the search results for a particular sObject type.
- Governor limits thrown exceptions cannot be handled.
- Custom exceptions can be top level classes, and supports variables, methods, and constructors.
- Execution of post-commit logic, such as sending emails will happen after all DML operations are committed to the database.
- Trigger.new contains a list of the new versions of sObject records that is available in insert, update, and undelete triggers.
- Salesforce does not allow callouts to be made after DML operations in the same transaction. Doing so will throw the "You have uncommitted work pending" callout exception. To allow the callout to be made, DML operations first need to be rolled back using the Database.rollback() method, and second, the savepoint needs to be explicitly released using the Database.releaseSavepoint() method.
- If the callout needs to be made after the DML operation and avoid losing work, the recommended solution is to perform the callout in a separate transaction using asynchronous methods such as a future method.
- getMessage() returns the error message that is displayed to the user.
- getCause() returns the cause of exception as an Exception object.
- getStackTraceString() is used to return the stack trace as a string.
- getTypeName() method returns the exception type, such as DmlException, ListException, MathException, and so on.
- HTTP callout action in flow builder can be used to perform callouts declaratively.
- 'continue' keyword is used to skip the current iteration of a loop.
- 'break' keyword is used to exit the entire loop.
- SOQL for loops can be used to avoid the limit on heap size.
- Declaring a constant variable requires using the 'final' keyword.
- Semicolon and comma characters can be used to add filter logic when querying multi-select picklist fields. A semicolon is used as a special character to implement AND logic. A comma is used as a special character to implement OR logic.
- 'Section' screen component can be used to create multi-column collapsible sections in a flow screen.
- Null coalescing operator (??) operates in the syntax <left-hand argument> ?? <right-hand argument>. It returns right-hand argument whenever left-hand argument returns null.
- Two types of custom settings are hierarchy and list. List custom setting data provides a list of data that can be reused and accessed by different tools across an org. Hierarchy custom setting data uses a hierarchical logic and allows settings to be customized specifically to a profile or user.
- Custom settings data is exposed in the application cache, which avoids repeated queries to the database.
- Hierarchy custom settings can be accessed in Apex using Custom Settings methods or in formula fields, validation rules, flows, and processes using the $Setup variable.
- List custom settings can only be accessed in Apex or through API calls.
- Salesforce no longer recommends using List custom settings, Custom metadata types are preferred since, unlike custom settings, custom metadata types can be migrated to other orgs using packages or Metadata API tools.
- SOQL statement can be used to either return a single record, a list of records or an integer (when COUNT method is used).
- An object's field values can be populated programmatically using the Trigger.new context variable for "before" triggers.
- A variable defined in the for-loop can be implicitly converted using the rules of conversion. (an integer can be implicitly converted into a double).
- Limits.getDMLRows() returns the number of records that have been processed using any DML statement that counts against the DML limits.
- Limits.getLimitDMLRows() returns the actual DML rows limit.
- Limits.getLimitDMLStatements() returns the number of DML operations that can be called in a single transaction.
- Salesforce allows creating tests in flow builder specifically for record-triggered flows. 'View Tests' button is used to manage flow tests.
- In Apex, currency fields are automatically assigned the type Decimal.
- Invocable methods support using the generic sObject type as an output parameter as well as an input parameter.
- A flow can be set to run in a system context without sharing.
- The only formula functions that work with Geolocation are ISBLANK, ISCHANGED, and ISNULL. Also, equality or comparison operators can't be used with geolocations.
- When implementing a List iteration using a SOQL for-loop, records are automatically processed in batches of 200 and avoid exceeding the heap size limit (6MB).
- The 'Run flow as another user' option available in 'Debug Flow' menu in flow builder allows executing an action or performing CRUD operation on a record as a specific user.
- In addition to DML statements such as insert, update, upsert, delete, undelete and merge, other method calls such as AApproval.process(), Database.convertLead(), Database.emptyRecycleBin(), Database.rollback(). Database.setSavePoint(), EventBus.publish(), and System.runAs() also count toward the governor limit of the total number of DML statements that can be issued in a single transaction.
- A platform event-triggered flow created in flow builder can subscribe to a specific platform event. When a platform event message is published, it invokes the flow, which can perform the necessary record updates based on the event message data available in the $Record global variable.
- Salesforce allows adding a scheduled delay to a queuable job using the System.enqueueJob() method. The delay value in minutes (min 0, max 10) can be passed as the second parameter.
- Org-wide default delay for all queuable jobs can be set in Setup > Apex Settings. Using System.enqueueJob() to delay a job overrides the org-wide default delay for the job.
- Flow builder can be used to create a flow that executes an action type called 'Send Survey Information'. It can automatically email survey invitations to leads, contacts, or users.
- addAll() method is used to add a list to a list collection.
- The @JsonAccess annotation can be used for an Apex class to determine in which context it is allowed to be serialized or deserialized. For example: @JsonAccess(serializable='never' deserializable='always').
- An 'after update' trigger cannot change field values on the record that triggered it. Field values on related records can be updated.
- The maximum stack depth for triggers in Salesforce is 16.
- Address fields on standard objects are compound data types and cannot be directly modified. Instead, each individual component of the Address field must be modified.
- A SOSL query returns List<List<sObject>>.
- $Record_Prior global variable in flow builder can be used to access previous field values of the updated record.
- Trigger.new records can only be edited in 'before' triggers. A FinalException will occur if Trigger.new records are edited in 'after' triggers.
- An Apex web service (REST or SOAP-based) is created when an external system beeds to communicate and perform operations in Salesforce (inbound communication).
- External applications can subscribe to platform event using the Pub/Sub API, which uses the gRPC (Google Remote Procedural Call) framework for performing cross-platform high performance communication. An alternative subscription method is via CometD, which is a routing bus that performs long polling to receive platform event messages from Salesforce. In long polling, the external application connects and requests the information from Salesforce, and if no information is available yet, Salesforce holds the request and waits until a platform event is fired.
- Flow Trigger Explorer helps in identifying which record-triggered flows are run when a record of a specific object is created, updated, or deleted.
- Flow Trigger Explorer allows sorting of the execution order of the flows via drag-and-drop options and automatically updates the 'Trigger Order' property value of each record-triggered flow.
- SEARCH clause does not exist in SOSL.
- Dot notation is used to reference fields from parent objects in SOQL.
- Nested SELECT statement is used to query child records.
- The switch control flow statement is capable of handling multiple values in its when block as well as enum values.
- Create a Case is a prebuilt flow named Create a Case that can be customized based on the requirements and saved as a new flow.
- The delete DML statement will only count as 1 towards the governor limit of DML statements regardless of the number of records contained in the list.
- The FIELDS function in SOQL can be used to select fields without specifying the field names of the target sObject.
- A part of a record-triggered flow can be run at a dynamically scheduled time after the tiggering event occurs by adding a scheduled path to the flow.
- A failed flow interview is not saved if the error came from a flow that is inactive, a platform event-triggered flow, from a managed package (and is not a template), or from an Apex test method.
- The getQueryRows() method of the Limits class returns the number of rows that have been returned by SOQL queries.
- The lightning/empApi module, which contains empApi methods, can be imported via the component's JavaScript controller to allow the Lightning web component to subscribe to platform events.
- The DML undelete statement is used to restore deleted records from the recycle bin.
- The 'Trigger Order' property is available in the advanced properties of a record-triggered flow, which can be used to specify when the flow is executed in a transaction that involves other flows.
- Flows with the same 'Trigger Order' values are executed based on their API names in alphabetical order.
- The Trigger.operationType is a trigger variable that returns the context of the executing DML operation. The available context values are BEFORE_INSERT, BEFORE_UPDATE, BEFORE_DELETE, AFTER_INSERT, AFTER_UPDATE, AFTER_DELETE, and AFTER_UNDELETE.
- Event object types end with the suffix '__e'.
- Platform events only support 'after insert' triggers.
- SOQL queries return DateTime fields as Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) values.
- Date or DateTime values in queries are not enclosed in quotes.
- Virtual classes cannot contain abstract methods.
- Abstract classes are allowed to contain virtual methods.
- A virtual method contains a body and can be overridden by an extending class. However, an abstract method only contains a signature and has no body, as it is up to the extending class to provide the body for the method.
- Governor limit exceptions cannot be handled.
- Custom exception classes can be defined as virtual classes so that they can be extended by another custom exception class.
- The protected access modifier enables a method to be visible to inner classes of the Apex class it is defined in as well as extensions of the class.
- Protected access modifier cannot be used on static methods and is only allowed on instance methods and member variables.
- A method or variable is private if an access modifier is not specified.
- Flow builder, process builder as well as the REST API provide the capability to send custom notifications.
- There are two ways to invoke a flow from apex: Flow.Interview.FlowName(params).start(); and Flow.Interview.createInterview('FlowName', params).start(); Parameters are contained in a Map<String, Object>.
- Flow can access and update external object data as well as Salesforce data.
- The DML merge operation can only process up to three records at a time.
- 'Uncommitted work pending' error is thrown when a callout is executed after a DML operation in a single transaction. Screen flows can be used to work around this limitation by executing the callout in a new transaction.
- 'callout=true' attribute in the invocable method annotation is used to make the flow aware that the method contains a callout.
- Configuring the flow to always start a new transaction would also avoid the 'uncommitted work pending' error.
- A 'Wait for Conditions' element can be added to the flow to receive platform event messages.
- The THIS keyword in apex is used to represent the current instance of a class. It can also be used in constructor chaining in a class that contains multiple constructors.
- Definition modifiers (such as virtual, abstract) are optional.
- Scheduled delay to a queuable job can be added using the System.enqueueJob() method. The delay value in minutes (min 0, max 10) can be passed to the second parameter of the enqueueJob() method.
- Platform events only support 'after insert' triggers.
- If an error origins from a flow that is either inactive, a platform event-triggered flow, from a managed package (and is not a template), or the error was thrown as a result of an Apex test method, then the flow interview is not saved in the org and the notification email does not inclide a link to the flow interview.
- Custom email handler can be defined to handle inbound emails and perform operations such as creating or updating records based on the email content.
- The subscription of the trigger to the platform event can be suspended.
- 'Trigger.new' records can only be edited in 'before' triggers.
- The isExecuting context variable returns true if any code inside the trigger context is executing.
